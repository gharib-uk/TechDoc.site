    "content": "Mail-Sec SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \u0026 Conformance) are essential email authentication protocols that work together to improve email security. Here’s a breakdown of their full security benefits:\n1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework) Purpose: SPF helps prevent email spoofing by allowing domain owners to specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain. Security Benefits: Reduces Email Spoofing: SPF prevents attackers from sending fraudulent emails that appear to come from a trusted domain by verifying the sending server’s IP address against the authorized list. Protects Against Phishing: Since SPF helps ensure that only legitimate mail servers can send emails, it reduces the likelihood of phishing emails that appear to come from a trusted source. Improves Deliverability: Legitimate emails are less likely to be marked as spam or rejected, improving the overall email deliverability rate. 2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) Purpose: DKIM adds a cryptographic signature to email headers, allowing the recipient to verify that the message has not been tampered with and that it comes from the claimed sender. Security Benefits: Message Integrity: DKIM ensures that the content of the email has not been altered in transit. If an email is tampered with, the DKIM signature will be invalid, alerting the recipient. Authentication of Sender: By verifying that the DKIM signature matches the sender’s domain, DKIM authenticates the legitimacy of the message and helps protect against email impersonation. Enhanced Trust: With DKIM in place, recipients can trust that the email was sent by the domain owner and has not been tampered with, reducing the risk of impersonation and fraud. 3. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \u0026 Conformance) Purpose: DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM by adding a policy framework that specifies how email receivers should handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks, and it provides reporting mechanisms for domain owners. Security Benefits: Policy Enforcement: DMARC allows domain owners to specify whether emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks should be quarantined, rejected, or allowed through. This gives domain owners more control over how their domain is used in email communications. Reduces Spoofing and Phishing: By aligning SPF and DKIM with the “From” domain in the email, DMARC ensures that malicious actors cannot spoof the domain, making phishing and impersonation attacks less likely. Visibility and Reporting: DMARC provides reporting tools that help domain owners monitor email activity and identify any abuse of their domain. This gives them visibility into who is sending emails on behalf of their domain, and allows them to take corrective actions if necessary. Increased Trust for Recipients: By implementing DMARC, organizations demonstrate to email recipients that they take email security seriously, leading to better trust and higher engagement with their emails. Helps Prevent Brand Abuse: By preventing unauthorized use of an organization’s domain in email communications, DMARC protects against reputational damage caused by fraudulent emails that impersonate the brand. Combined Security Benefits of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Stronger Authentication: Together, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC provide a multi-layered approach to email authentication, greatly reducing the risk of unauthorized use of your domain for malicious purposes. Improved Email Security: The combination of these protocols prevents a wide range of email-based attacks, including phishing, spoofing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Enhanced Email Deliverability: Emails that pass SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks are less likely to be flagged as spam or rejected by receiving mail servers, improving the chance that legitimate emails are delivered to recipients’ inboxes. Global Protection: By enforcing these protocols, you help protect your domain from being exploited across the global email ecosystem, reducing the potential for large-scale attacks like business email compromise (BEC). Summary By implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, organizations can significantly enhance their email security posture. These protocols work in tandem to authenticate the sender, protect the integrity of the email, enforce policies on unauthenticated messages, and provide valuable insights through reporting, making them essential for any organization concerned with email fraud and abuse.",

It’s best done in your local .config directory because 1) you don’t need sudo and 2) you are pretty much guaranteed that your changes won’t be blown away by an update.\nThe tracker Binary Running tracker will give you a vast array of tools to check on tracker and manage its processes.\n$ tracker usage: tracker [--version] [--help] \u003ccommand\u003e [\u003cargs\u003e] Available tracker commands are: daemon Start, stop, pause and list processes responsible for indexing content info Show information known about local files or items indexed index Backup, restore, import and (re)index by MIME type or file name reset Reset or remove index and revert configurations to defaults search Search for content indexed or show content by type sparql Query and update the index using SPARQL or search, list and tree the ontology sql Query the database at the lowest level using SQL status Show the indexing progress, content statistics and index state tag Create, list or delete tags for indexed content See 'tracker help \u003ccommand\u003e' to read about a specific subcommand. Non-Invasive Disable Cheat Sheet This disables everything but tracker-store, which even though it has a .desktop file, seems tenacious and starts up anyway. However, nothing gets indexed.\ntracker daemon -t cd ~/.config/autostart cp -v /etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-*.desktop ./ for FILE in tracker-*.desktop; do echo Hidden=true \u003e\u003e $FILE; done rm -rf ~/.cache/tracker ~/.local/share/tracker Note that tracker daemon -t is for graceful termination. If you are having issues terminating processes or just want to take your frustration out, tracker daemon -k immediately kills all processes.\nAfter this is done, tracker-store will still start on the next boot. However, nothing will be indexed. Your disk and CPU will be better for wear.\n$ tracker status Currently indexed: 0 files, 0 folders Remaining space on database partition: 123 GB (78.9%) All data miners are idle, indexing complete Other References https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker/ https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Tracker http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s05.html",

To enter darknet, download Tor Browser. It’s a modified Firefox that allows access to the dark web and is configured for higher security.\nYou may get Tor Browser for Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Android here:\nhttps://www.torproject.org/download/\nFor iOS the recommended browser is Onion Browser:\nhttps://onionbrowser.com/\nAlternatively you can use Brave Browser. It supports Tor and Onion protocols. It’s simple to use, and avaible on both desktop and mobile devices\nhttps://brave.com/download/\nIs it legal to enter dark web? Using Tor is legal in most countries. It’s illegal to perform certain activities, depending on your residency these may include: buying or selling drugs, weapons, counterfeit money, abusive materials etc.\nWhat is darknet? The Web consists of three large areas:\nsurface web (often called clearnet, cleannet) — publicly accessible resources, e.g. search engines, news, social media that can be indexed by search engines deep web — resources not indexed by search engines, because they are protected by password or stored behind public services, e.g. companies internal platforms, medical records, research papers, legal documents dark web — resources that can be accessed only with specific software, they are not accessible from standard web browser, e.g. whistleblowers secure drops, secret communication channels for activist, journalists, human rights activists but also many illegal marketplaces and shops What is Tor? Tor (The Onion Router) is an open-source software that bounces Internet traffic through a worldwide network consisting of almost million relays in order to hide user’s location and protect him against surveillance or traffic analysis. Tor makes more difficult to trace Internet activity: websites visits, online posts, instant messages and other communication forms.\nHow Tor works? Your traffic passes through 3 intermediate nodes before reaching destination. Each of the 3 nodes has separate layer of encryption and nobody who watches your connection can read what you send and where.\nTor layers Guard node — knows your IP address but doesn’t know where you connect to and what you send to destination Middle node — immediate layer between guard node and exit node Exit node — knows destination but doesn’t know who you are What are hidden services? Hidden services are accessible only within Tor network. Their domain names end with .onion. They are not indexed by any public search engine. The only way to enter .onion sites is to know equal address. You can find some example deep web links in table above.\nHow to find hidden services There are many tor link lists, wikis and catalogues where you can find addresses to .onion sites. There are also many link lists in clearnet but majority of them is not updated and most links do not work. It’s standard that hidden services work for small amount of time and dissappear forever.\nThis github page is maintained by voluteers, that makes this page get updated more often - to provide better access to information.\nThere are some darknet search engines mostly created by amateurs and they are very limited due to hidden services nature.\nBefore accessing any darknet site, make sure that it’s legal in your country to browse content that they contain.\nWho created Tor? The idea of onion routing was created in 1995 at the U.S. Naval Research Lab by David Goldschlag, Mike Reed and Paul Syverson in effect of a research to find a way to create Internet connections that don’t reveal who is talking to whom. The reason was to protect US intelligence communications online.\nIn early 2000s, Roger Dingledine (MIT graduate) with Paul Syverson began working on the onion routing project created at Naval Research Lab. To distinguish their work from other efforts, they named the project Tor (The Onion Routing).\nTor was oficially deployed in October 2002 and its source code was released under a free and open software license. In December 2006 computer scientists Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson and five others founded The Tor Project research-education nonprofit organization that is responsible for maintaining the software.\nTor is supported by US government, many NGOs, private foundations, research institutions, private companies and over 20,000 personal donations from people from around the World.",

You will learn how to find vulnerabilities in code and how to design software systems that limit the impact of security vulnerabilities. We will focus on principles for building secure systems and give many real world examples.\nStanford University - Computer Security Stanford University - Cryptography I This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange. Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.\nStanford University - Cryptography I Stanford University - Cryptography II This course is a continuation of Crypto I and explains the inner workings of public-key systems and cryptographic protocols. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with constructions for digital signatures and their applications. We will then discuss protocols for user authentication and zero-knowledge protocols. Next we will turn to privacy applications of cryptography supporting anonymous credentials and private database lookup.
